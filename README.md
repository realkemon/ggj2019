The game **'Among Silhouettes'** was created for the [Global Game Jam 2019](https://globalgamejam.org/2019/games/among-silhouettes) with the topic *'What home means to you'*. 
It is a monochrome, 2D coop platformer with the player goal to complete all rooms. Player A is in the upper white half, while Player B is in the lower black half of the screen. Several objects are scattered across the rooms that are not visible for the players since their colour matches the respective half's background. If a player passes such an object, the avatar passes 'behind' it and is, therefore, able to find it. Once found, the object is outlined in the contrasting colour and also added to the player's inventory.

To complete and subsequently pass a room in the game, all objects need to be in the correct half (floor) of the room. Hints about the necessary objects for each floor are provided as symbols besides the respective door. These doors open once all objects are placed correctly. Objects can be moved from one floor to the other through holes in the middle. Each player standing on top or under a hole can select an object in their inventory to move it to the other floor.
